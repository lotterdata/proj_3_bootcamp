    "# Lucky Numbers: An Indirect Look at Lottery Players' Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "In a lottery game, the numbers that the lottery selects are random, but the numbers that players choose to play are not. To the best of my knowledge, data on player selections are not publicly available. However, lotteries do publish data on the numbers they draw and the amounts of the prizes they award. In games where prizes are parimutuel, that is when a certain percentage of sales is divided equally among the winners, one can infer the popularity of the numbers drawn from the prize amounts: popular numbers result in smaller prizes because there are more winners splitting the prize money. The primary component of this project is scraping a variety of lottery websites using a variety of techniques in order to gather data for an analysis that relates prizes amounts to the numbers drawn. Ultimately, I would like to build machine learning models that predict prize amounts as a function of the numbers drawn. However, here I simply do some hypothesis tests to investigate whether there is a relationship between prize amounts and the sum of the numbers drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scraping Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project a single observation is a lottery drawing, with the data comprising a date, the numbers drawn by the lottery, the number of winners at each prize level, and the prize amount at each level. In order to get all of these data components, one has to visit a separate page for each drawing. Beautiful Soup can easily scrape each ot these pages, so the primary challenge was visiting each page within a site in an automated fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I was accessing several different websites, I had to employ several different strategies. In increasing order of complexity they were: encoding dates into URL's, using Selenium to click a link, and using Selenium to fill in a form.\n",

    "### Encoding Dates into a URL\n",

As a extra safety measure, the also checks that the date on the page matches the one entered into the form before writing the results to a file.

    "Building models that predict prize amounts from the numbers drawn is beyond the scope of this project, but there are some statistical tests we can do that will provide evidence that such models are possible. The contention is that large prize amounts are associated with large drawn numbers and small prize amounts are associated with small drawn numbers. \n",

For each game we will select a prize level and examine the draws with prize amounts less than or equal to the 25th percentile and the draws with prize amounts greater than or equal to the 75th percentile. For each of the draws with small prizes amounts, we will calculate the sum of the numbers drawn and find the mean of these sums. Then we will calculate the probability that the same number of random draws would result in a mean as low or lower than what we observed. We will do the same for draws with large prizes, except that the probability calculation will be the probability that the same number of random draws would result in a mean as high or higher than what we observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need some functions to carry out these tests, starting with the the mean and variance of the sum of $k$ integers drawn at random, without replacement, from the set $\\{1,...,n\\}$. The formula for the mean follows from linearity of expectation and the fact that each draw has an expected value of $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. The formula for the variance is a slight modification of the formula for the variance of the test statistic in the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. One source for more details is the <a href = 'https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Wilcoxon.html'>R documentation</a>."

Moreover, since mid-September of 2008 the second prize has been capped at \\$555, and if there is any extra money left it is addded to the third-prize pool.

    "The tests presented here provide multiple examples of parimutuel lotteries where there is a relationship between the numbers drawn and the prize amounts. Therefore the project of predicting prize amounts from the drawn numbers is likely to produce some results, and using the sum of the drawn numbers appears to be a great starting point."
